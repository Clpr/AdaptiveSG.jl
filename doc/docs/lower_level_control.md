# Lower level API

The package exports a collection of useful lower-level functions for advanced users
who need lower level control of the ASG interpolant, esp. modifying the grid structure.
These functions are also helpful for integrating `AdaptiveSG.jl` into their existing workflows.

This section explains the API in addition to the docstring of the functions.
